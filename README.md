This is the repo for the final project for Monash Data Analysis Bootcamp. 

Title: Global Average temperature prediction

For this project, I built an interactive webpage for the user to key in a date (YY-MM-DD) of their own choice, and the webpage will display the predicted average global temperature from a prophet model of the date introduced. 

The prophet model is trained with 100 years of global average temperature data sourced from Kaggle.
